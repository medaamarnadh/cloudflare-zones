# cloudflare-zones
Are you using a cloudflare enterprice plan ?

Do you have more than 50 / 100 zones in your account ?

In that case, we will have a problem to filter our zones to get details and filtering list as well. 

I am giving a good solution to avoid this problem by using Cloudflare API and JQuery data tables. 

By using this interface you can filter your zones and download zones list which is not available in cloudflare interface.
